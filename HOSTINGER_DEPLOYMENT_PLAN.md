# Deployment Plan for tfsmypetrolstation.in (Hostinger)

## Current Situation
- **Domain**: tfsmypetrolstation.in
- **Hosting Provider**: Hostinger
- **Current Status**: Fresh Hostinger setup page

## Deployment Strategy Options

### Option 1: Check Hostinger Plan Capabilities
First, we need to verify what your Hostinger plan supports:

#### Hostinger Business/Premium Plans Usually Support:
- ✅ PHP applications
- ✅ MySQL databases
- ✅ Static file hosting
- ❓ Node.js (some plans)
- ❓ Python/Flask (limited support)

#### What to Check in Your Hostinger Control Panel:
1. Login to hpanel.hostinger.com
2. Look for "Node.js Selector" or "Python App"
3. Check available database options (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
4. Verify if you can run custom applications

### Option 2A: If Hostinger Supports Node.js
- Deploy React frontend as static build
- Convert Flask backend to Express.js (Node.js)
- Use MySQL database instead of SQLite

### Option 2B: If Hostinger is PHP-Only
- Deploy React frontend as static build  
- Keep Flask backend on external service (Railway/Render)
- Connect frontend to external API

### Option 3: Hybrid Deployment (Recommended)
- **Frontend**: Upload React build to Hostinger (static files)
- **Backend**: Deploy Flask to Railway/Render (free tier)
- **Domain**: Point tfsmypetrolstation.in to static files
- **API**: Backend runs on subdomain or external URL

## Next Steps Required

### Step 1: Check Your Hostinger Plan
Please check your Hostinger control panel for:
- [ ] Node.js support
- [ ] Python support  
- [ ] Database options available
- [ ] File upload capabilities

### Step 2: Prepare Application for Deployment
- [ ] Build React frontend for production
- [ ] Prepare database migration scripts
- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Configure API endpoints for production

### Step 3: Deploy Based on Hosting Capabilities
Will depend on what we find in Step 1.

## Files We'll Need to Prepare

### Frontend Production Build:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# This creates a 'dist' folder with static files
```

### Backend Options:
1. **If Node.js supported**: Convert Flask to Express.js
2. **If PHP only**: Keep Flask on external service
3. **If Python supported**: Deploy Flask directly

## Database Migration:
- Export current SQLite data
- Import to MySQL (Hostinger) or PostgreSQL (external)

## What I Need From You:
1. **Hostinger Control Panel Access** (or screenshots of capabilities)
2. **Your hosting plan details** (shared/business/premium)
3. **Preference**: Keep current tech stack vs. convert to PHP/Node.js
