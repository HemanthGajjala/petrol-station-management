# GitHub Repository Setup Commands

## After creating repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd "c:\Users\GHemanthReddy\PMS\New folder (2)\petrol_station_clean"

# Add GitHub repository as remote (replace with your actual GitHub repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/petrol-station-management.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Then in Railway:
1. Click "GitHub Repo"
2. Select your repository: "petrol-station-management"
3. Railway will auto-detect Flask backend
4. Deploy!

## What Railway Will Do Automatically:
- ✅ Detect Python Flask app
- ✅ Install dependencies from requirements.txt
- ✅ Create PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Deploy with public URL
- ✅ Handle SSL certificates

## After Backend Deploys:
- We'll deploy the React frontend separately
- Connect frontend to backend API
- Point your domain to Railway

Ready to create GitHub repository!
