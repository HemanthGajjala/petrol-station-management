# Railway Deployment Guide for Petrol Station Management System

## Current Step: Railway Dashboard Setup

### What to Click Next:

1. **Click "GitHub Repo"** in the Railway dashboard
2. **Connect your GitHub account** (if not already connected)
3. **Upload your project to GitHub first** (we need to do this step)

## Before We Continue - Let's Prepare:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
We need to upload your code to GitHub first so Railway can access it.

### Step 2: Railway Will Auto-Deploy
Once connected, Railway will:
- ✅ Detect your Flask backend automatically
- ✅ Install Python dependencies from requirements.txt
- ✅ Set up database (PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Provide a public URL
- ✅ Handle SSL certificates

### Step 3: Frontend Deployment
We'll deploy the React frontend separately to Railway as well.

## Files I Just Created for Railway:

### 1. `Procfile` 
Tells Railway how to start your backend server

### 2. `railway.json`
Railway configuration for optimal deployment

### Your app.py is already Railway-ready!
✅ Uses host='0.0.0.0' 
✅ Runs on port 5000
✅ Has all dependencies in requirements.txt

## Next Actions:

1. **First**: Let's upload to GitHub
2. **Then**: Connect GitHub to Railway
3. **Finally**: Deploy both frontend and backend

## Data Safety:
- Railway will create a new PostgreSQL database
- We'll migrate your SQLite data safely
- Your local system stays as backup
